## Description
Due to the unprecedented shift to a remote workforce, it can be difficult for teams to create and maintain a cohesive bond. New members joining a team may find it harder to connect with peers. Managers may not have the right tools to help bring their team together. Enter: Team Builder! Our application aims to help build teams, foster creativity, and strengthen culture.

Users can securely login into the application using a social media account or an email address and password. 

Once in the app, users can:
- Review or update their profiles, which includes their full name, nick name (if they have one), associated team, and ice breaker questions. 
- Create a team to bring users together or view teams and their current members
- Play a game with their team. Select a team and ice breaker question to start and have some fun with our matching game while getting to know your team mates. 

When playing the game, we recommend designating one person as the facilitator. The facilitator can screenshare the game and everyone can participate by shouting out an answer. (Make sure you are not on mute!)
